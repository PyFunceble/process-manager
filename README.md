# pyfunceble-process-manager

**The process manager library for and from the PyFunceble project.**

This is a project component that was initially part of the PyFunceble project.
It aims to separate the process manager from the main project to allow others
to use it without the need to install the whole PyFunceble project.

# Installation

```sh
pip3 install pyfunceble-process-manager
```

## Usage / Example

```python
from typing import Any
from PyFunceble.ext.process_manager import ProcessManagerCore, WorkerCore


class DataFilterWorker(WorkerCore):

    def perform_external_poweron_checks(self) -> bool:
        # This can be used to perform checks before starting the worker.
        # If False is returned, the worker will not start.
        return super().perform_external_poweron_checks()

    def perform_external_poweroff_checks(self) -> bool:
        # This can be used to perform checks before stopping the worker.
        return super().perform_external_poweroff_checks()

    def perform_external_preflight_checks(self) -> bool:
        # This can be used to implement your own logic before the worker
        # starts processing the next data.
        return super().perform_external_preflight_checks()

    def perform_external_inflight_checks(self, consumed: Any) -> bool:
        # This can be used to filter out the consumed data by returning False.
        # For example, filter out data that is not a string.

        print("DataFilter consumed:", consumed)

        if not isinstance(consumed, str):

            print("DataFilter filtered out:", consumed)

            return False
        return super().perform_external_inflight_checks(consumed)

    def perform_external_postflight_checks(self, produced: Any) -> bool:
        # This can be used to implement your own logic after the worker
        # has processed the data.

        print("DataFilter produced:", produced)

        return super().perform_external_postflight_checks(produced)

    def target(self, consumed: Any) -> Any:
        # Here we simply convert the string to uppercase as an example of data processing.
        return consumed.upper()


class DataPrinterWorker(WorkerCore):
    def target(self, consumed: Any) -> Any:
        print("DataPrinter consumed:", consumed)
        return consumed


class DataFilterManager(ProcessManagerCore):
    WORKER_CLASS = DataFilterWorker


class DataPrinterManager(ProcessManagerCore):
    WORKER_CLASS = DataPrinterWorker


if __name__ == "__main__":
    # By default, our interfaces will log to the console.

    data_to_filter = [
        "hello",
        "world",
        123,  # This will be filtered out because it's not a string.
        "PyFunceble",
        None,  # This will be filtered out because it's not a string.
    ]

    # Configure the manager to generate 2 workers/processes.
    data_filter_manager = DataFilterManager(
        max_workers=2, generate_output_queue=True, output_queue_count=1
    )
    # Configure the manager to generate 1 worker/process.
    data_printer_manager = DataPrinterManager(
        max_workers=1,
        input_queue=data_filter_manager.output_queues[0],
        generate_output_queue=False,
    )

    # Start the manager.
    data_filter_manager.start()
    data_printer_manager.start()

    # Push the data to the input queue for further processing.
    for data in data_to_filter:
        print("Controller pushed:", data)
        data_filter_manager.push_to_input_queue(data)

    # Push the stop signal at the end of the input queue to stop the workers.
    # Note:
    #   As the data printer is a dependency of the data filter, we don't need to
    #   stop it explicitly. It will be stopped automatically when the data filter
    #   manager stops.
    #
    data_filter_manager.push_stop_signal()
    # Wait for the manager to finish processing the data.
    data_filter_manager.wait()

    # If we want to terminate the manager and all workers, we can call the terminate method.
    data_filter_manager.terminate()

    print("Data filtered successfully.")
